To keep the repository size small we save the output data here:
[https://stfc365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/alexander_prokopyszyn_stfc_ac_uk/Documents/GitHub/locust_2024_paper_code_output_data?csf=1&web=1&e=Cmqo1s](https://stfc365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/alexander_prokopyszyn_stfc_ac_uk/Documents/GitHub/locust_2024_paper_code_output_data?csf=1&web=1&e=Cmqo1s)
I had to put the files on my work account as it exceeds the 30 GB limit. You will need to email me for access if you want to access them outside STFC.
